  while not decided:
    prepare(n) : monotonically increasing n
    set n as the highest n_a, n seen so far from prepare_ok responses
    if prepare_ok(n, n_a, v_a) from a majority:
      if v_a was not null from a prepare_ok, set proposed value to v_a, otherwise keep it the same
      accept(n, v)
